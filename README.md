2016 Utah Visualization Course Final Project 

Visualizing basketball player abilities properly based on statistics is always a hot for sport analysts and basketball fans. There are various basketball data analyzing tools on the internet nowadays, but not many of them can provide user-friendly up-to-date visualizations for general purposes. As basketball enthusiasts, we want to provide such an easy-to-use player profiler for non-experts to explore data and create visualizations based on their own demands.
