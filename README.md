### Motivation
> Visualizing basketball player abilities properly based on statistics is always a hot for sport analysts and basketball fans. There are various basketball data analyzing tools on the internet nowadays, but not many of them can provide user-friendly up-to-date visualizations for general purposes. As basketball enthusiasts, we want to provide such an easy-to-use player profiler for non-experts to explore data and create visualizations based on their own demands.

### Project Structure

We stored files based on file functions:

* [data] - All data files including JSON, CSV, TXT, etc
* [documents] - All documentations of this project, excluding the README.md. The process book is stored inside this folder also
* [external] - All external libraries that we used inside the project. They are *d3*, *d3-hexbin*, *d3-legend*, *d3-queue* and *d3-tip*
* [python] - Python scripts we used for gathering and preprocessing data
* [script] - All JavaScript files wrotten by our group
* [stylesheets] - stylesheets used in this project. The *cssmain.css* is the one wrotten by our group, the rests are generated by the github page.
* [index.html] - The main page of our project
